# 🧠 User Onboarding Agent  

## 1️⃣ Use Case  
The **User Onboarding Agent** is an autonomous solution that automates the process of onboarding new employees into **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** and **Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (F&O)** with minimal human intervention.  

It monitors incoming onboarding requests (such as HR emails or future ServiceNow tickets), extracts employee data, validates job duties, and provisions users automatically using **Power Automate flows** and **Teams Adaptive Card approvals**.

### Typical Workflow  
1. **Trigger** – HR sends an onboarding email containing new-hire details.
   ![Onboarding Email](./images/OnboardingEmail.png)
3. **Extraction** – The agent uses Azure OpenAI to parse the message, extracting name, title, department, and duties.  
4. **Processing** – Data is sent to the main Power Automate flow `D365OnboardingAgentV3` for user creation.  
5. **Approval** – Adaptive Cards are posted in Microsoft Teams for IT admins to review and approve.  
6. **Provisioning** – Upon approval, the agent:
   - Creates the user in Azure AD  
   - Assigns Microsoft 365 and F&O licenses (Future Release)  
   - Suggests D365 roles based on job duties using AI  
   - Assigns approved roles and completes onboarding

## 6️⃣ Extensibility Guidelines and Setup Instructions  

Extension flows act as **modular entry points** that enable external systems such as **ServiceNow, Workday, or HR onboarding portals** to programmatically trigger the onboarding process through secure HTTP endpoints.  
Each extension flow functions as a lightweight integration layer — **receiving structured employee data**, performing basic validation, and **invoking the central Copilot-driven onboarding logic** within Power Automate.  

This design allows new systems to be integrated easily without modifying the core agent, ensuring **scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability** across enterprise HR and IT ecosystems.  

---

### 🚀 Create the Main Flow – `OnboardingRequestExtension`  
This flow acts as the **external entry point** for onboarding requests.  

#### Steps  
1. Create a new **Instant Cloud Flow** using the **HTTP Request trigger**.  
2. Use the following **Request Body JSON Schema**:  

   ```json
   {
     "type": "object",
     "properties": {
       "fullName": { "type": "string" },
       "email": { "type": "string" },
       "jobTitle": { "type": "string" },
       "location": { "type": "string" },
       "startDate": { "type": "string" },
       "duties": { "type": "string" }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Under **Who can trigger the flow**, select **Anyone**  
   ⚠️ *This configuration is intended for **testing purposes only** (e.g., validation via Postman or internal test flows).*  
   In production, always follow Microsoft security guidelines and adopt the best practices below.  

4. Save and copy the **HTTP POST URL** — this will be used by external systems or test flows to trigger onboarding requests.  

---

### 🔒 Security and Access Best Practices  

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | Use **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** authentication or **Power Platform Environment Access Policies** to restrict flow execution to trusted systems. Avoid “Anyone” for production. |
| **Environment Separation** | Use distinct environments for **Development**, **Testing**, and **Production** with separate flow URLs. |
| **IP Whitelisting** | Configure firewalls or API gateways to only allow inbound requests from trusted IP ranges (e.g., ServiceNow or internal subnets). |
| **Least Privilege Principle** | The connection used for Copilot execution should have the **minimum necessary permissions**. |
| **Auditing** | Enable **Dataverse** or **Application Insights logging** for request metadata (timestamp, source, requester). |
| **Key Rotation** | Regenerate HTTP trigger URLs periodically or upon ownership changes. |
| **Data Handling** | Validate and sanitize incoming payloads before processing to prevent injection or malformed input risks. |

---

### ⚙️ Add Step – Execute Agent  

Add the **Execute Copilot** connector (Microsoft Copilot Studio) with the following configuration:  

- **Agent Name:** `UserOnboardingAgent`  
- **Body / Message Example:**  

  ```
  User Onboarding request received through extension.

  User information is:
  Full Name: @{triggerBody()?['fullName']}
  Email: @{triggerBody()?['email']}
  Job Title: @{triggerBody()?['jobTitle']}
  Location: @{triggerBody()?['location']}
  Start Date: @{triggerBody()?['startDate']}
  Duties: @{triggerBody()?['duties']}
  ```

This step passes structured data to the Copilot Agent for further decision-making.  

---

### 🧠 Testing the Extension Flow  

1. Create a new flow named **`TestUserOnboardingAgentExtension`** to simulate external system calls.  
2. Add a **Manual Trigger**.  
3. Add an **HTTP action** configured as:  

   - **Method:** `POST`  
   - **URI:** *(Paste the HTTP POST URL of the `OnboardingRequestExtension` flow)*  
   - **Headers:**  
     `Content-Type: application/json`  
   - **Body Example:**  
     ```json
     {
       "fullName": "Lindsey Garaham",
       "email": "Lindsey.Garaham@Dynamics365SA.com",
       "jobTitle": "Finance Business Analyst",
       "location": "Redmond",
       "startDate": "",
       "duties": "Managing AP invoice reviews, preparing monthly financial reports, and collaborating with the operations team for budget forecasting."
     }
     ```

4. Publish and run the test flow to confirm Copilot execution.  

---

### 🔄 Extension Design Pattern  

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Any HTTP-capable system (ServiceNow, HR portal, custom app) can call the `OnboardingRequestExtension` endpoint. |
| **Schema** | The JSON payload standardizes onboarding attributes passed to Copilot. |
| **Copilot Invocation** | The “Execute Copilot” action routes data to `UserOnboardingAgent` for role analysis and user provisioning. |
| **Reusability** | Multiple systems can reuse the same endpoint and schema for modular integration. |

---

### 🧩 Adding New Extensions  

1. Duplicate the `OnboardingRequestExtension` flow and rename it (e.g., `OnboardingRequestExtension_ServiceNow`).  
2. Modify the input schema if additional parameters (e.g., department, managerID) are required.  
3. In the “Execute Copilot” action, update the body message accordingly.  
4. Publish and share the new flow URL with the target system team.  

---

### 🧱 Example Integrations  

- **ServiceNow:** Trigger Power Automate via *Flow Designer → REST Step* calling the HTTP URL.  
- **Email Parser:** Connect Power Automate’s Outlook trigger and pass parsed fields to the same schema.  
- **Teams Request:** Build an Adaptive Card form and use the same payload to trigger onboarding.  

---

## 7️⃣ Roadmap / Upcoming Enhancements  

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Offboarding Functionality** | Automate user deactivation, license removal, and F&O role cleanup. |
| **License Suggestion and Assignment** | Introduce AI-based recommendations for M365 and D365 licenses based on department and duties. |
| **Auto-Generation of Role/Duty Mapping CSV** | A Power Automate flow to automatically refresh duties-to-roles mapping in OneDrive. |

### Transparency and Security Boundaries

This agent template is provided as a starting point for building agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio. It does not represent a deployed or managed Microsoft service and is intended to be configured, extended, and operated by customers within their own tenant. Microsoft Copilot Studio enforces a set of platform‑level security, privacy, and Responsible AI guardrails, including but not limited to:
- isolation boundaries between tenants,
- prompt‑injection and misuse protections,
- Responsible AI safeguards and policy enforcement.

These protections are inherited automatically by agents built using standard Copilot Studio functionality and are not re‑implemented or modified by this template. This template introduces no additional security controls beyond the Copilot Studio platform. Customers are responsible for reviewing and validating their final agent configuration, especially when:
- extending prompts or instructions,
- connecting the agent to enterprise data sources,
- enabling actions or integrations,
- deploying the agent to production users.

Customers should perform their own security, compliance, and risk assessments to ensure the final agent meets their organizational and regulatory requirements.

---

### Customer responsibilities

This template is not deployed by Microsoft and does not make assumptions about customer data, identity models, permissions, or compliance requirements.

Customers are responsible for:
- validating data access and permissions,
- configuring security and compliance controls,
- performing any required risk, privacy, or regulatory assessments,
- and ensuring the final deployed agent complies with internal and external policies.

This template inherits the security and Responsible AI protections of Microsoft Copilot Studio. It does not add or replace platform‑level controls and is intended to be adapted and governed by customers within their own deployment context.
